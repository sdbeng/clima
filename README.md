# clima
Dockerized django App to check the weather(clima).

##docker-compose up
Note: your localhost won't work here because docker has its own network so,
in order to run the server for the first time, run:

`docker-compose up`

that command will run the server with the prev command:port configured in the current docker-compose.yml file.
